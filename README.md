Project Description:
Have you ever wondered Canadian’s employment income for new graduates? And what kind of characteristics driven to those different levels of income? In this project, we will analyze a dataset which contains Canadian’s median employment income of postsecondary graduates two years after graduation by degree, field of study, gender, age group and status from 2010-2015, the goal is to answer to following questions:

- Which fields of study have the highest income?
- Does gender or age affect the median income in the same field of study?
- Which type of accreditation yields the highest new graduate income?
- Is there a relationship between the number of graduates and income?
